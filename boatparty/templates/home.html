            <p class="text-left">Natalie first saw Nick at a party in Pacific Beach, CA. Everyone seemed to know who he
                was except for her. She thought he was cute so she asked her friends about him. Soon after, mutual
                friends Evan [Tarver] and Katie [Plack] set them up on a bit of a movie date to see the newest Harry
                Potter. After being forced to sit “boy girl” “boy girl”, they hit it off! He took her to In and Out soon
                after and
                the rest is history.</p>

            <p class="text-left">After a short train ride up Uetliberg Mountain and an even shorter hike, Nick and
                Natalie found themselves sitting on a bench, taking in a beautiful view of Zurich. Nick pretended to set
                up a camera on a tripod for a self-timed photo but really, he began recording a video. While he had
                planned a speech similar to a recoupling speech on Love Island, nerves got him and all he could get out
                was “Will you be my companion forever?” After some pictures, the two made their way to celebrate at the
                most on brand place possible, a Beer garden.</p>
