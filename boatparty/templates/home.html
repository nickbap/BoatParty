    Hello Lovely Guests!
    <br />
    <br />
    We want to share a quick update about the big day. Our
    venue is currently following the <a href="https://coronavirus.marinhhs.org/masks" target="_blank">guidelines</a>
    set by Marin County: <strong>‚ÄúMarin County joined other Bay Area
        Counties in requiring the use of masks indoors by all people -- vaccinated or unvaccinated -- out of an
        abundance of caution due to a rising number of COVID-19 cases.

        Masks are not required outdoors, but are strongly recommended in crowded environments.‚Äù</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner are completely outdoors. The only activities that are partly indoors
    are the dance
    floor and the shuttle services.
    <br />
    <br />
    Please bring a mask if you plan on taking the shuttle or plan to go inside to the dance floor area. We think
    it's
    safe to say, just bring a mask in general. üôÉ
    <br />
    <br />
    We want you to come to our wedding because you are comfortable and want to celebrate with us. If you aren't
    feeling
    up to it any longer, no hard feelings! Please, just let us know in advance. If you feel safer wearing a
    mask,
    that's cool too! You do <strong><em><u>you</u></em></strong>! We just want everyone to have a good time in whatever
    way
    suits them best!
    <br />
    <br />

                was except for her. She thought he was cute so she asked her friends about him. Soon after, mutual
                friends Evan [Tarver] and Katie [Plack] set them up on a bit of a movie date to see the newest Harry
                Potter. After being forced to sit ‚Äúboy girl‚Äù ‚Äúboy girl‚Äù, they hit it off! He took her to In and Out soon
                after and
                the rest is history.</p>

            <p class="text-left">After a short train ride up Uetliberg Mountain and an even shorter hike, Nick and
                Natalie found themselves sitting on a bench, taking in a beautiful view of Zurich. Nick pretended to set
                up a camera on a tripod for a self-timed photo but really, he began recording a video. While he had
                planned a speech similar to a recoupling speech on Love Island, nerves got him and all he could get out
                was ‚ÄúWill you be my companion forever?‚Äù After some pictures, the two made their way to celebrate at the
                most on brand place possible, a Beer garden.</p>
